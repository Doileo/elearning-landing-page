- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Working on this project was a great opportunity to learn and use the transform property for the project's images. The most challenging part was to position the desktop hero image because at the first attempts it was cutted off.

Here is the CSS code snippet:

```css
.hero-container {
    background: url(../assets/image-hero-desktop@2x.png);
    background-size: 936px;
    background-position: top -8rem right -19rem;
    background-repeat: no-repeat;
    max-width: 144rem;
    padding-bottom: 10rem;
    margin-left: 10rem;
    transform: translateY(-15%);
  }
```

### Useful resources

- [Resource 1](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform-function/translate) - This helped me for changing the images position.
